				<h1> Patrick James F. Fetizanan </h1>
				<hr>
				
				<p> 	I am Patrick James
					F. Fetizanan and I am 1<sup>st</sup> year College Student currently attending
					Cavite State University – Imus Campus in the course of Bachelor of Science in
					Computer Science. During my Senior High School, I have chosen to take a
					Technical-Vocational-Livelihood Track that the studies focuses on Computer
					System Servicing NCII although there’s a big difference in TVL-CSS and
					Computer Science I decide to take it as a challenge to myself to learn more
					beyond and thanks to TVL-CSS I have a prior knowledge about computer hardware
					and also troubleshoot a computer. Although my educational choices have evolved
					around my academic subjects, I have also found enjoyment and creativity in
					Visual Arts, Programming, and Journalism.
